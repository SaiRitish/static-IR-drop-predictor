# static-IR-drop-predictor

Static IR drop prediction in Power Delivery Net- works (PDNs) is crucial for ensuring reliable chip performance, especially in advanced sub-7nm nodes. Traditional methods based on solving GV = J are computationally intensive and fail to scale with modern circuit complexities. In this paper, we propose a hybrid U-Net-based architecture enhanced with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and encoder-decoder techniques. By integrating spatial and topological features with Kirchhoffâ€™s law constraints, we achieve high prediction accuracy and gener- alization. We trained the model on a limited dataset of 100 synthetic circuits and evaluated it on 10 real circuit benchmarks, consistently delivering a significant improvement in precision over existing techniques. By employing innovations such as skip connections and shape-adaptive convolutional kernels, we enable accurate hotspot prediction and generalization across diverse PDN configurations. By reframing IR drop prediction as an image- to-image translation task, we provide a scalable and efficient solution, advancing the state-of-the-art in PDN analysis.
